# Devlog: colors
**Basic Idea: simple platformer based around the idea of color**  
Controls: arrow keys or 'w a s' to move, space to swap colors

3/23:
- basic player movement and level generation
- game logic inspired by multiple documents and videos on platformer games

3/24:
- added player collision and jumping mechanic
- added different color blocks (death blocks and portals)
- added player color swap feature
- added simple FPS counter
- decided on what game mechanics I want to base the game around and eventually the title of the game

3/25:
- frick.
- anything I tried to do today just ended up making more bugs and complications so rest day to think through

3/26:
- fixed bugs
- added code to prevent players from swapping colors while in a block
- added a pretty neat effect when a player goes through a block
- created level one of the actual game and I'm actually satisfied with how it turned out

3/27:
- implemented a temporary solution to the color indexes and whatnot
- created level two of the game although it might be a bit too out of the box (pun intended)

3/28:
- optimized code displaying level blocks so that it does not draw every single block each frame but a single image containing the blocks each frame
- created level three of the game but something still looks off :/

3/29:
- created level four and I think I unintentionally and accidentally created one of the most frustrating levels in this game
- started working on level five of the game

3/30:
- finished level five (not completely satisfied though)
- started working on level six of the game

4/10:
- finished level six (not sure if it's good enough though)
- finished end level
- added the required input function along with printing directions, level names, and hints

4/11:
- cleaned up stuff

4/13:
- added more clear instructions as to which blocks kill the player and colors player can change to
- added a little wait timer to add some time for player to read

4/18:
- added comments
